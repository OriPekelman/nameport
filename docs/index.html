    <h2>What it does</h2>
    <p>nameport is a daemon that watches your machine for HTTP services, gives them human-friendly names, and reverse-proxies them through <code>.localhost</code> domains. No config files, no <code>/etc/hosts</code>, no DNS server.</p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">

  <!-- How it works -->
  <section>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>nameport runs a daemon that binds to ports 80 and 443. It continuously scans for listening TCP ports on your machine, probes each one to verify it speaks HTTP, then generates a human-readable <code>.localhost</code> domain using heuristics based on the process name, working directory, or app bundle.</p>
    <p>Every discovered service gets a reverse proxy entry. Open <code>http://myapp.localhost</code> in your browser and traffic is forwarded to the right port. Collisions are handled automatically: <code>myapp.localhost</code>, <code>myapp-1.localhost</code>, <code>myapp-2.localhost</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>.localhost</code> TLD is reserved by IANA (RFC 6761) and resolves to <code>127.0.0.1</code> in all modern browsers without any DNS configuration.</p>

    <h2>Inspired by</h2>
    <p>nameport is the spiritual successor to <a href="https://github.com/FlorentVll662662/dns-to-port">dns-to-port</a> by <strong>Florian Margaine</strong>, who saw the problem first and built the original solution. nameport shares dns-to-port's MIT license and community values while adding automatic discovery, zero configuration, and a web dashboard.</p>

  <!-- Security warning -->
  <section class="security-warning">
    <h3>Security notice</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No code has been read by a human.</strong> This project was written entirely with AI assistance. No human has reviewed the source line by line.</li>
      <li><strong>The local CA can create certificates for any domain on the whitelist.</strong> Trusting it in your system keychain is a real security risk. A compromised daemon could issue certificates and intercept traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardcoded defenses exist</strong> (TLD whitelist restricted to <code>.localhost</code>, <code>.test</code>, <code>.internal</code>; full IANA public TLD blocklist), but the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks remains if the CA key is compromised.</li>
      <li><strong>No binaries are provided.</strong> Clone the repository and run <code>make</code> yourself. Read the code if you can.</li>

  <!-- Quick start -->
  <section class="quickstart">
    <h2>Quick start</h2>
    <p>Requires Go 1.21+ and root access for port 80.</p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/OriPekelman/nameport.git
cd nameport
make
sudo ./nameport-daemon</code></pre>
    <p>Start any local HTTP server and it appears automatically:</p>
    <pre><code>cd ~/projects/myapp && python3 -m http.server 3000
# opens at http://myapp.localhost</code></pre>
